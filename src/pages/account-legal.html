                        Part 2 - Booking parking spots
                        25.    You agree that Get Parked will act for the Owner in all dealings between Parker and Owner.  You agree to make all bookings for the parking spot only through the Website and acknowledge that Get Parked will handle all the booking and payment process on the Owner's behalf.  
                        26.    You must provide all the information we require to enable your use of the Website as a parker or Owner as the case may be.  You must ensure that the information is correct from time to time.
                        27.    You agree that the Website is a platform for advertising and booking parking spots owned or controlled by Owners and we have no responsibility for the parking spot other than to provide the Services under this agreement which includes operating the Website and administering and confirming bookings and collecting payment on behalf of the Owner.
                        28.    Whilst we endeavour to ensure the parking spots advertised on the Website are of a satisfactory quality we offer no warranty as to a parking spot's suitability for your requirements.  Similarly, we will have relied on the Owner for details about a parking spot given on the Website and whilst we use reasonable efforts to verify the accuracy of such information we offer no warranty in relation to these details.
                        29.    We are not responsible for the location or condition of a parking spot, its availability or the conduct of the Owner during the Parking Period.  We act as agent for the Owner and by making a booking you are entering an agreement with the Owner under which the Owner is bound to provide you with the parking spot, subject always to the Parker Agreement.
                        30.    Unless stated otherwise in this agreement, once we have confirmed your booking we have no further obligation to you in relation to the parking spot and all responsibility lies with the Owner.  We aim to ensure that our Owners offer a good service and provide their parking spot in accordance with your expectations but we accept no responsibility and will have no liability to you if the parking spot or the services of the Owner generally do not meet your requirements or you find them unsatisfactory in any way. Your right of action or claim in such circumstances will be against the Owner but we may assist (at our discretion) in seeking to resolve a dispute between you and the Owner.
                        31.    We are not responsible for the location or condition of a parking spot, its availability or the conduct of the Owner during the Parking Period.  We act as agent for the Owner and by making a booking you are entering an agreement with the Owner under which the Owner is bound to provide you with the parking spot, subject always to the Parker Agreement.
                        32.    You must:
                        (a)    If you are a Parker agree to observe and act in accordance with each Parker Agreement;
                        (b)    not use the parking spot in any way which could be deemed to be harmful to the business or reputation of Get Parked or do anything which might adversely affect our relationship with an Owner;
                        (c)    not attempt to contact a Owner directly at any time;
                        (d)    not attempt to book any parking spot advertised on the Website other than through the booking procedure on the Website;
                        (e)    provide us with accurate information and ensure that all details that we hold about you (including your email address) are up to date and valid;
                        (f)    not use the Website in any way which may detrimentally affect the reputation of Get Parked or the use and enjoyment of the Website or our services by any other users or third parties;
                        (g)    maintain insurance on the vehicle as required by applicable law; and
                        (h)    where applicable, only provide us with credit or debit card details for which you are the sole account holder.
                        33.    All bookings are made subject to the cancellation policy as set out on the Website and you agree to comply with the terms of the cancellation policy and you authorise Get Parked to administer the cancellation policy, including if necessary, by making refunds.
                        34.    Normally amounts are quoted to include GST.  However, if fees or charges payable under this Agreement are calculated or quoted exclusive of GST Get Parked may add GST to any such amount and the GST shall be payable at the same time as fee, charge or other amount is payable.  If the fee, charge or other amount is inclusive of GST but the rate of GST varies from that previously applicable, Get Parked may vary it accordingly.
                        35.    The Australian Consumer Law (ACL) provides consumers with guarantees that cannot be excluded, restricted or modified. This Agreement does not affect any rights you have under the ACL or any other legal rights which cannot be excluded or modified.  
                        36.    To the extent permitted by the ACL and subject to any other legal restriction, Get Parked excludes:
                        (a)    any terms, conditions, warranties, guarantees or other liability that might apply to Owner in respect of this Agreement or anything done under it; and
                        (b)    any liability for any indirect, special, consequential or economic loss or damage whether or not arising from default or negligence by Owner or its employees or agents.
                        37.    For services other than services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption Get Parked limits its liability, as permitted by the ACL, at its option, to the re-supply of the services or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.
                        38.    You must indemnify Get Parked in respect of all losses, costs or expenses which Get Parked suffers or incurs in respect of: (a) a breach of this agreement by you, including enforcing this Agreement; (b) the vehicle; or (c) your use of a the Website or any parking spot or a Car Park.  In the case of paragraphs (b) and (c) your liability to indemnify us is reduced to the extent that any relevant expense is caused by Get Parked's negligence or default.   This sub-clause does not affect any rights you have under the ACL or other law which cannot be excluded or modified.  
                        39.    Get Parked may give you notice under this Agreement by sending a notice to you at the address you give in your booking or any other address you notify to Get Parked or at any other address where Get Parked reasonably believes you to work, stay or reside.  If you give Get Parked an email address, Get Parked may also give you notices by email to that address.  Get Parked may also give you a notice by leaving it on or in your vehicle inside or outside a Car Park.  Each of these ways of giving you notice may also be used to give you notice for the purposes of any legal proceedings.  You should notify Get Parked if your contact details change.
                        Part 3 - General provisions
                        40.    If you breach any term of this agreement, and fail to remedy such a breach Get Parked may, without prejudice to its other rights hereunder, immediately terminate this agreement.  
                        41.    You must pay Owner and Get Parked their full costs of any action to recover amounts you owe including Get Parked and Owner’s legal and mercantile agents’ fees on a full indemnity basis.
                        42.    These terms of use supersede any prior agreements between you and us in respect of your use of the Website.  You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use particular services available on or through the Website including any Parker Agreement or Owner Agreement. 
                        43.    Your rights and obligations under these terms of use are personal and may not be assigned or dealt with in any way without our approval, which we may withhold in our absolute discretion.
                        44.    These terms of use and the relationship between you and us are governed by the laws in force in the State of New South Wales, Australia without regard to its conflict of law provisions.  You agree to submit to the personal and non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in the State of New South Wales.
                        45.    Words in this agreement importing the singular include the plural and vice versa. Words importing gender include every other gender. Words importing persons include bodies corporate and vice versa. Any indemnity or agreement on the part of two or more persons shall be deemed to bind them jointly and severally. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these terms of use must not be treated as a waiver of the right or provision. 
                        46.    Get Parked may vary the terms of this Agreement by notice to you. Get Parked may transfer both its rights and obligations under this agreement and you must sign any novation or other document Get Parked reasonably requires for that purpose.  
                        47.    You warrant that you are not aggregator or supplier of parking or parking-related services of any kind and are not acting as an agent for any such person.  If Get Parked reasonably believe you are in breach of this warranty Get Parked may cancel this agreement and any booking immediately without any refund and refuse to provide services whether or not that has been previously notified.
                        48.    To the extent that any provision or part of this agreement is either invalid or unenforceable by any applicable law that provisions or part shall be ineffective and shall not invalidate or modify the remaining provisions or parts hereof, which shall continue in full force and effect. 
                        49.     Get Parked is committed to your privacy.  Get Parked generally collect personal information about you directly from you, but may also collect personal information about you from third parties.  Get Parked uses your personal information to provide parking-related services to you, to seek your feedback about their service, to carry out management and administrative activities (including debt collection), to conduct research and to communicate with you.  If all the information is not provided, Get Parked may not be able to supply their services to you.  Your personal information may be disclosed to Get Parked's related entities, service providers and contractors, debt collection agencies, auditors, and as a result of contractual obligations, Get Parked may be required to disclose your personal information to landlords of parking facilities.  
                        50.    Get Parked has a privacy policy which includes information about how it collects, stores, uses and discloses your personal information; about how you may access the personal information about you that Get Parked holds, and how you may seek correction of that information; and about how you may complain about a breach by Get Parked of the Australian Privacy Principles, and how Get Parked will deal with such a complaint. -->
